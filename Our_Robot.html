        <center><div class="paragraph">When we first found out what the game would be this year, we did a lot of brainstorming. We originally had the idea of making a tennis ball launcher, but as time passed we had the idea of making a spring mechanism in order to catapult the game pieces in the targets. We thought this was a better idea. Suggestions and designs would be tossed around for a while until we had a brief idea of what we would build. 
            <p>For the Vertigoal game, our robot will be made out of a baby stroller for the frame and hockey sticks, which will be used to make the structure and the launcher. We started by getting the excess pieces of of the stroller, such as the seat. Then we devided ourselves in sub-groups to make different components for the robot. These counted the color sensors, the frame, the catapult and many more. </p>
            
            <p>Through our process, the worst problem we have faced was time. It took a long time to create stability within the robot, and the wiring took longer than expected which might end up causing problems as well in the future. Even though these problems were encountered, we have found ways to overcome them. When it came to the stability, we found the idea of using hockey sticks whithin the robot, which would be lighter than wood and would be just as effective. For the shortage of time, we have found many ways to pass this problem. For one, we would go to school during a pedagogical day, or we would try to stay at school as long as we could.</p>
